# Welcome to Kang's Space

Hi there!

Welcome to my personal space on GitHub. This is where I document my journey, share projects, and explore new ideas.

### What I’m Learning
This journey has had its challenges, but each step has made me stronger. I’m continuously learning and growing, and I use this platform to reflect on and document that progress.

### A Work in Progress
Some of the lessons have been tough, but they've all contributed to my growth. Here, you'll find notes, projects, and experiments as I navigate through these experiences. I hope you find them useful or inspiring!

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to learn and share.

Best,  
Kang
