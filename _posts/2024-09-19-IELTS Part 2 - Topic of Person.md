手工耿以制作各种创意手工品而著名，其中一个让我印象深刻的例子是他制作的“烧烤钢琴”。这个项目展示了他如何将一个普通的烧烤架改造成一个可以演奏的钢琴。制作过程不仅非常复杂，还需要他在每个细节上都花费心思。他把烧烤架的结构进行了改造，使它可以发出音乐声，并且添加了一些装饰，使它看起来既实用又具有艺术感。

One person who comes to mind when thinking about someone who likes to make things by hand is a well-known content creator on Bilibili named <span style="color:red">手工耿</span>. His real surname is <span style="color:red">耿</span>, and his nickname <span style="color:red">手工</span> means "by hand," which perfectly captures his passion for <span style="color:red">handcrafting</span>.

<span style="color:red">手工耿</span> is famous for his unique and creative <span style="color:red">hand-made projects</span>. One example that stands out is his creation of a "<span style="color:red">BBQ piano</span>." In this project, he transformed a regular <span style="color:red">barbecue grill</span> into a functional <span style="color:red">piano</span>. The process was intricate and involved modifying the grill’s structure to produce musical sounds, and he also added decorative elements to make it both practical and visually appealing.

I think he enjoys making things by hand because it allows him to showcase his <span style="color:red">creativity</span> and <span style="color:red">technical skills</span>. Each project reflects his meticulous attention to <span style="color:red">detail</span> and personal touch.

## Part 2 帮助亲人


About four years ago, right after my cousin had just finished her <span style="color:red">college entrance exams</span>, I helped her out with a pretty big <span style="color:red">decision</span>. She’s my <span style="color:red">aunt’s daughter</span>, and back then, she wasn’t sure about what to <span style="color:red">study</span> or which <span style="color:red">university</span> to apply to. Since I had more <span style="color:red">experience</span> with the <span style="color:red">job market</span> and knew how things were shaping up, I decided to step in.

I helped her by researching <span style="color:red">schools</span> and checking their <span style="color:red">admission scores</span>, as well as the <span style="color:red">cutoff marks</span> for different <span style="color:red">majors</span>. Based on her exam results, I recommended a few <span style="color:red">universities</span> that would be a good fit. I also suggested she major in <span style="color:red">computer science</span> because, in my opinion, it has great <span style="color:red">job prospects</span>. I could tell she trusted my advice, which made me feel pretty good about the whole thing.

Fast forward to today, and she’s just graduated this year and already landed a <span style="color:red">solid job</span>. It honestly made me really happy because, first of all, I realized I’m someone they can count on. And secondly, she’s enjoying the field I suggested, which makes me feel like I really did something useful. It’s nice to know I could steer her in the right direction.

A person from whom others frequently seek advice is my <span style="color:red">mentor</span> at PayPal. He’s about four years older than me, and his <span style="color:red">experience</span> and <span style="color:red">insights</span> are highly valued.

People turn to him because he’s incredibly skilled at helping individuals improve their <span style="color:red">work skills</span> and address <span style="color:red">errors</span>.

His advice is spot-on, whether it’s about adjusting to <span style="color:red">corporate life</span> or managing <span style="color:red">project priorities</span>.

He often gives practical tips on <span style="color:red">communication</span>. For example, he advises against sending one-liner messages on Slack and suggests writing complete thoughts, just like you would in an <span style="color:red">email</span>. He’s also shared valuable <span style="color:red">remote working strategies</span>, like being patient with colleagues across different <span style="color:red">time zones</span> and using polite language like “could you please” rather than pushing for immediate responses.

His guidance extends to managing <span style="color:red">expectations</span>, both from <span style="color:red">managers</span> and <span style="color:red">co-workers</span>. He’s taught me how to handle <span style="color:red">project priorities</span> effectively and maintain a balanced approach when working with others.

## Part 2 喜欢读书的人


One of my teammates at XXX, <span style="color:red">Alex</span>, is someone who really enjoys <span style="color:red">reading</span>. We’re in the same group and department, and I got to know him after joining the company. We’ve worked on several <span style="color:red">projects</span> together, and he’s also my <span style="color:red">mentor</span>, so I’ve had the chance to see how knowledgeable he is, especially when it comes to <span style="color:red">management</span> and <span style="color:red">communication</span>.

Alex is the kind of person who seems to read everything. He often talks about <span style="color:red">books</span> on <span style="color:red">project management</span>, <span style="color:red">communication skills</span>, <span style="color:red">leadership</span>, and even technical topics like <span style="color:red">coding</span>. In fact, he’s written a few <span style="color:red">books</span> himself, mostly about <span style="color:red">management</span> and <span style="color:red">team dynamics</span>, which shows just how deeply he engages with the material he reads.

I believe Alex loves reading because he’s always eager to <span style="color:red">learn</span> something new. Whenever I ask him questions about work or general topics, he almost always has an answer ready, as if he’s read about everything. It’s impressive how much he knows, and I think his habit of reading a lot is what gives him such a broad understanding of different subjects. He’s one of those people who never seems to stop learning, which is something I really admire about him.

Alex is someone who isn’t hesitant to express his views on various topics, particularly regarding how to excel in a <span style="color:red">software company</span>. One area where his opinions are particularly strong is the importance of improving <span style="color:red">visibility</span> at work through effective <span style="color:red">communication</span>. He firmly believes that for <span style="color:red">career advancement</span> and <span style="color:red">project success</span>, it’s crucial not just to excel in <span style="color:red">technical skills</span> but also to actively communicate your achievements and ideas.

## Part 2 重新联络的老朋友


Alright, so I’d like to talk about an old friend I lost touch with but reconnected with recently. His name is <span style="color:red">Alex</span>, and he used to be my <span style="color:red">roommate</span> in university. We met about eight years ago when we both started the same <span style="color:red">major</span>. We had a lot of <span style="color:red">classes</span> together, and because we were roommates, we spent a ton of time <span style="color:red">studying</span> and <span style="color:red">hanging out</span>. We got along really well.

After we graduated, though, we kind of drifted apart. He moved to the north of China for work, while I came to <span style="color:red">Shanghai</span>. You know how it is—<span style="color:red">life</span> gets busy, and we were in different cities, working different jobs. We just didn’t keep in touch as much.

Then, a few months ago, out of the blue, I got a message from him. It turned out he was getting <span style="color:red">married</span> and wanted to invite me to his <span style="color:red">wedding</span>! I was really surprised but also super happy to hear from him. We hadn’t spoken in years, but he still remembered me, which felt great. So, we started <span style="color:red">chatting</span> again, catching up on what we’d both been up to, and it was like no time had passed.

After reconnecting, I felt a bit <span style="color:red">nostalgic</span>. It was nice to be in touch with someone who knew me from my university days, and it reminded me of how important <span style="color:red">old friendships</span> are. I’m really glad we reconnected, and now we’re planning to stay in touch more regularly.
