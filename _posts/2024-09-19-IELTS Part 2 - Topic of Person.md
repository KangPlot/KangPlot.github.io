One person who comes to mind when thinking about someone who likes to make things by hand is a well-known content creator on Bilibili named <span style="color:red">手工耿</span>. His real surname is <span style="color:red">耿</span>, and his nickname <span style="color:red">手工</span> means "by hand," which perfectly captures his passion for <span style="color:red">handcrafting</span>.

<span style="color:red">手工耿</span> is famous for his unique and creative <span style="color:red">hand-made projects</span>. One example that stands out is his creation of a "<span style="color:red">BBQ piano</span>." In this project, he transformed a regular <span style="color:red">barbecue grill</span> into a functional <span style="color:red">piano</span>. The process was intricate and involved modifying the grill’s structure to produce musical sounds, and he also added decorative elements to make it both practical and visually appealing.

I think he enjoys making things by hand because it allows him to showcase his <span style="color:red">creativity</span> and <span style="color:red">technical skills</span>. Each project reflects his meticulous attention to <span style="color:red">detail</span> and personal touch.

## Part 2 帮助亲人


About four years ago, right after my cousin had just finished her <span style="color:red">college entrance exams</span>, I helped her out with a pretty big <span style="color:red">decision</span>. She’s my <span style="color:red">aunt’s daughter</span>, and back then, she wasn’t sure about what to <span style="color:red">study</span> or which <span style="color:red">university</span> to apply to. Since I had more <span style="color:red">experience</span> with the <span style="color:red">job market</span> and knew how things were shaping up, I decided to step in.

I helped her by researching <span style="color:red">schools</span> and checking their <span style="color:red">admission scores</span>, as well as the <span style="color:red">cutoff marks</span> for different <span style="color:red">majors</span>. Based on her exam results, I recommended a few <span style="color:red">universities</span> that would be a good fit. I also suggested she major in <span style="color:red">computer science</span> because, in my opinion, it has great <span style="color:red">job prospects</span>. I could tell she trusted my advice, which made me feel pretty good about the whole thing.

Fast forward to today, and she’s just graduated this year and already landed a <span style="color:red">solid job</span>. It honestly made me really happy because, first of all, I realized I’m someone they can count on. And secondly, she’s enjoying the field I suggested, which makes me feel like I really did something useful. It’s nice to know I could steer her in the right direction.

A person from whom others frequently seek advice is my <span style="color:red">mentor</span> at PayPal. He’s about four years older than me, and his <span style="color:red">experience</span> and <span style="color:red">insights</span> are highly valued.

His advice is spot-on, whether it’s about adjusting to <span style="color:red">corporate life</span> or managing <span style="color:red">project priorities</span>.

He often gives practical tips on <span style="color:red">communication</span>. For example, he advises against sending one-liner messages on Slack and suggests writing complete thoughts, just like you would in an <span style="color:red">email</span>. He’s also shared valuable <span style="color:red">remote working strategies</span>, like being patient with colleagues across different <span style="color:red">time zones</span> and using polite language like “could you please” rather than pushing for immediate responses.

His guidance extends to managing <span style="color:red">expectations</span>, both from <span style="color:red">managers</span> and <span style="color:red">co-workers</span>. He’s taught me how to handle <span style="color:red">project priorities</span> effectively and maintain a balanced approach when working with others.

## Part 2 喜欢读书的人


One of my teammates at XXX, <span style="color:red">Alex</span>, is someone who really enjoys <span style="color:red">reading</span>. We’re in the same group and department, and I got to know him after joining the company. We’ve worked on several <span style="color:red">projects</span> together, and he’s also my <span style="color:red">mentor</span>, so I’ve had the chance to see how knowledgeable he is, especially when it comes to <span style="color:red">management</span> and <span style="color:red">communication</span>.

Alex is the kind of person who seems to read everything. He often talks about <span style="color:red">books</span> on <span style="color:red">project management</span>, <span style="color:red">communication skills</span>, <span style="color:red">leadership</span>, and even technical topics like <span style="color:red">coding</span>. In fact, he’s written a few <span style="color:red">books</span> himself, mostly about <span style="color:red">management</span> and <span style="color:red">team dynamics</span>, which shows just how deeply he engages with the material he reads.

I believe Alex loves reading because he’s always eager to <span style="color:red">learn</span> something new. Whenever I ask him questions about work or general topics, he almost always has an answer ready, as if he’s read about everything. It’s impressive how much he knows, and I think his habit of reading a lot is what gives him such a broad understanding of different subjects. He’s one of those people who never seems to stop learning, which is something I really admire about him.

## Part 2 固执己见的人

He’s also been a <span style="color:red">mentor</span> to me, which has given me valuable insights into his perspectives and beliefs.

Alex is someone who isn’t hesitant to express his views on various topics, particularly regarding how to excel in a <span style="color:red">software company</span>. One area where his opinions are particularly strong is the importance of improving <span style="color:red">visibility</span> at work through effective <span style="color:red">communication</span>. He firmly believes that for <span style="color:red">career advancement</span> and <span style="color:red">project success</span>, it’s crucial not just to excel in <span style="color:red">technical skills</span> but also to actively communicate your achievements and ideas.

For example, Alex emphasizes that regularly sharing <span style="color:red">progress updates</span>, engaging in <span style="color:red">team discussions</span>, and providing <span style="color:red">constructive feedback</span> are key to getting noticed and making a significant impact. He argues that visibility is not only about showcasing your own work but also about contributing to <span style="color:red">team goals</span> and building strong professional relationships.

I think Alex’s opinions are so compelling because they are grounded in his extensive experience and understanding of the <span style="color:red">software industry</span>.

## Part 2 重新联络的老朋友


Alright, so I’d like to talk about an old friend I lost touch with but reconnected with recently. His name is <span style="color:red">Alex</span>, and he used to be my <span style="color:red">roommate</span> in university. We met about eight years ago when we both started the same <span style="color:red">major</span>. We had a lot of <span style="color:red">classes</span> together, and because we were roommates, we spent a ton of time <span style="color:red">studying</span> and <span style="color:red">hanging out</span>. We got along really well.

After we graduated, though, we kind of drifted apart. He moved to the north of China for work, while I came to <span style="color:red">Shanghai</span>. You know how it is—<span style="color:red">life</span> gets busy, and we were in different cities, working different jobs. We just didn’t keep in touch as much.

Then, a few months ago, out of the blue, I got a message from him. It turned out he was getting <span style="color:red">married</span> and wanted to invite me to his <span style="color:red">wedding</span>! I was really surprised but also super happy to hear from him. We hadn’t spoken in years, but he still remembered me, which felt great. So, we started <span style="color:red">chatting</span> again, catching up on what we’d both been up to, and it was like no time had passed.

After reconnecting, I felt a bit <span style="color:red">nostalgic</span>. It was nice to be in touch with someone who knew me from my university days, and it reminded me of how important <span style="color:red">old friendships</span> are. I’m really glad we reconnected, and now we’re planning to stay in touch more regularly.
