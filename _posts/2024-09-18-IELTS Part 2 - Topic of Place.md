## Describe a crowded place you went to


Last Sunday, I went to Nanjing East Road metro station in Shanghai, which is hands down one of the busiest places I’ve ever been to. My relatives were visiting me, so I decided to play tour guide and take them to see the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower. We took the metro, and of course, we had to get off at Nanjing East Road station—it’s the closest stop, so there was no avoiding it. 

Honestly, we didn’t do much at the station itself; we just had to pass through it. But man, it was packed! I’m talking wall-to-wall people, like the place was a train station during rush hour, and it’s crazy how you have to line up just to exit. I mean, there were so many people, I almost couldn’t believe it. Especially on weekends, the number of tourists is just insane. It felt like the whole city decided to come out at the same time.

As Mark Twain once said, "A crowded place is a perfect place for reflection," but honestly, there was no time to reflect—I was just trying to navigate the sea of people!
