今天刚刚好是四月的生日，就是上面背景这只猫，为什么叫四月呢，因为明天是四月，两年前的3.31号收养的它，取名为 四月。

[Fresh start month](https://www.alexajade.co.uk/10-reasons-to-love-april/) 

I am not 100% sure why, but I have always thought of April as a month of fresh starts, apparently, I am not the only one. we are now 4 months clear of the Christmas season and it is a few months of enjoying the sun and the happy season before we prepare for cold winter months again! The first day of spring has now been and its time for a spring clean, mentally as well.
