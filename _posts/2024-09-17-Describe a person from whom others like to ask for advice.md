# Describe a person from whom others like to ask for advice
A person from whom others frequently seek advice is my mentor at PayPal. He’s about four years older than me, and his experience and insights are highly valued.

People turn to him because he’s incredibly skilled at helping individuals improve their work skills and address errors. He’s been instrumental in helping me ramp up on projects and navigate the transition from being a student to an employee. His advice is **spot-on**, whether it’s about adjusting to corporate life or managing project priorities.

He often gives practical tips on communication. For example, he advises against sending one-liner messages on Slack and suggests writing complete thoughts, just like you would in an email. He’s also shared valuable remote working strategies, like being patient with colleagues across different time zones and using polite language like **“could you please”** rather than pushing for immediate responses.

His guidance extends to managing expectations, both from managers and co-workers. He’s taught me how to handle project priorities effectively and maintain a balanced approach when working with others. Overall, I feel **incredibly grateful** for his mentorship. His advice has been a real <span style="color:red">game-changer</span> for my professional growth and has made a huge difference in my career.
