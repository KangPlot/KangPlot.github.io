# Describe a person from whom others like to ask for advice

A person from whom others frequently seek advice is my mentor at PayPal. He’s about four years older than me, and his experience and insights are highly valued.

People turn to him because he’s incredibly skilled at helping individuals improve their work skills and address errors. He’s been instrumental in helping me ramp up on projects and navigate the transition from being a student to an employee. His advice is <span style="color:purple">spot-on</span>, whether it’s about adjusting to corporate life or managing project priorities.

He often gives practical tips on communication. For example, he advises against sending one-liner messages on Slack and suggests writing complete thoughts, just like you would in an email. He’s also shared valuable remote working strategies, like being patient with colleagues across different time zones and using polite language like <span style="color:purple">“could you please”</span> rather than pushing for immediate responses.

His guidance extends to managing expectations, both from managers and co-workers. He’s taught me how to handle project priorities effectively and maintain a balanced approach when working with others. Overall, I feel <span style="color:purple">incredibly grateful</span> for his mentorship. His advice has been a real <span style="color:red">game-changer</span> for my professional growth and has made a huge difference in my career.

Describe an old person you know

---

One of the most inspiring older people I know is my grandfather. He lives in my hometown, a small village surrounded by mountains, which has always been a peaceful and close-knit community. Despite growing up in a rural area with limited resources, my grandfather has lived an incredible life. He worked as a farmer for most of his days, but what really stands out is his resilience and hard work. He raised a large family, providing for all of us through sheer determination and strength.

What amazes me most is his positive attitude, even in tough times. He’s always calm, wise, and full of stories from the past. He has this old-school wisdom that I really admire. Whenever I face challenges, I often think about how he handled hardships with grace and it motivates me to push through.

I have a deep sense of respect for him, not only because of what he’s achieved but also because of the values he’s instilled in me—humility, perseverance, and kindness. In a way, he’s been a guiding light for me, and I feel really fortunate to have him as a role model in my life.

Describe a movie you watched and enjoyed recently

---

Last Sunday night, I decided to have a cozy night in and watched a movie called *High Forces* at home, just by myself. You know, I’m single, so solo movie nights are kind of my thing these days, and honestly, it’s a great way to unwind.

The movie’s all about this elite special forces unit taking on high-stakes missions, packed with thrilling action scenes and some pretty intense moments. But the real reason I picked it? Andy Lau. He’s been my idol for as long as I can remember. I’ve always admired his versatility as an actor, and he didn’t disappoint in this one. 

His performance was just top-notch, as expected, and the film kept me hooked from start to finish. It wasn’t just about the action; it was seeing Andy Lau in his element that made it so enjoyable. I’ve gotta say, I had a blast watching it, and it reminded me why he’s been my favorite actor all these years.

Describe a crowded place you went to

---

Last Sunday, I went to Nanjing East Road metro station in Shanghai, which is hands down one of the busiest places I’ve ever been to. My relatives were visiting me, so I decided to play tour guide and take them to see the Bund and the Oriental Pearl Tower. We took the metro, and of course, we had to get off at Nanjing East Road station—it’s the closest stop, so there was no avoiding it. 

Honestly, we didn’t do much at the station itself; we just had to pass through it. But man, it was packed! I’m talking wall-to-wall people, like the place was a train station during rush hour, and it’s crazy how you have to line up just to exit. I mean, there were so many people, I almost couldn’t believe it. Especially on weekends, the number of tourists is just insane. It felt like the whole city decided to come out at the same time.

As Mark Twain once said, "A crowded place is a perfect place for reflection," but honestly, there was no time to reflect—I was just trying to navigate the sea of people!
